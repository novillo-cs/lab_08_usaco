## Directions:

* Write the bronze and silver outlines in the files bronze.md and silver.md

* Implement the solution for the bronze and silver problems. The following method must be implemented in the files Bronze.java and Silver.java. Do NOT change the method signature, if you do, you will lose points. 
  
```
public static long solve(String input_filename){

}
```

* You may have helper methods.

* In the Driver you may test your solutions like this:

```
long  bronzeSol = Bronze.solve("YOUR_FILE_HERE"); 
System.out.println("Bronze solution: " + bronzeSol);
long silverSol = Silver.solve("YOUR_FILE_HERE");
System.out.println("Silver solution: " + silverSol);
```

* Important: The file passed as an argument to the solve function should include the relative path. Do not use absolute paths, as they will not work when I run your code.

```
Absolute path: It is the complete address of a file or directory starting from the root of the file system.
Relative path: It is a location relative to the current working directory.
```

* Test your code with the two test cases provided. If you would like you can create your own test cases.
  
* Check if your solution is the same as the one provided in the output files.

## Reminders:

* Make sure your lab compiles before submit it. If it does not compile you will not receive any credit for the lab. You could resubmit a working version for partial credit (20% will be deducted).

* Late submissions will be penalized (20% will be deducted).
